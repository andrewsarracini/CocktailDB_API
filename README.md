# BeverageBuddy 

A gift for my wife, who loves cocktails *and* novelty, but can have trouble making her own choices. This is for you :) 

After a long day at work, settling down with your beverage of choice can provide an exceptionally relaxing environment. However, I've found that while creating beverages is relatively easy (and even fun), it's the tricky selection process that can make this exercise a total slog. Searching the internet for recipes often lands me amongst overly wordy blog posts that usually contain a single mediocre reciepe. What's more, I sometimes know the general "feeling" of a drink I'm interested in making, but increasing the granularity of my instructions would require a level of cocktail knowledge that I simply don't possess! For these reasons, as well as a sort of thank-you to my wife, I created `BeverageBuddy`.  

My dataset is generated from [TheCocktailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/) using their integrated, free to use API. `BevergaeBuddy` is a simple reccomendation system that suggests a list of beverages based on user-defined criteria (such as presence of alcohol, acidity, sugar level, etc). The UI was created using the `tkinter` library, the create a seamless input experience for the user. 

Further developments are in progress; 
- Generating output in the `tkinter` window, instead of within the terminal
- Adding novel beverages into the selection pool
- Additional columns to further aid classification and filtration.
